## Inspiration
CrowdFundIt is a decentralized crowdfunding application that allows users to raise funds for their projects without the need for a middleman. The inspiration for CrowdFundIt came from the frustration of seeing so many great projects fail due to a lack of funding. i believe that CrowdFundIt can help to level the playing field and give everyone a chance to make their dreams a reality.

## What it does
CrowdFundIt allows users to create campaigns to raise funds for their projects. Once a campaign is created, users can contribute ETH to the campaign. The funds are then transferred directly to the campaign creator, minus a small gas fee. CrowdFundIt also includes a number of features to help ensure that campaigns are successful, including:

Campaign validation: All campaigns must be validated before they can be funded. This helps to ensure that only legitimate campaigns are listed on the platform.
100% fund transfer: 100% of the funds raised in a campaign are transferred to the campaign creator. There are no fees or commissions taken by CrowdFundIt.
Chainlink integration: CrowdFundIt integrates with Chainlink to provide real-time ETH to USD conversion rates. This ensures that users always know how much their contribution is worth in USD.
Deadlines and targets: Campaigns have deadlines and targets. If a campaign does not reach its target by the deadline, no funds are transferred to the campaign creator. This helps to ensure that campaigns are realistic and achievable.
Mobile responsive UI: CrowdFundIt has a mobile responsive UI, which makes it easy to use on any device.
Easy to understand UI: CrowdFundIt has an easy to understand UI, which makes it easy for anyone to use, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Challenges I ran into
One of the biggest challenges I faced was building a decentralized application. Decentralized applications are more complex than traditional applications, and there are a number of security and scalability challenges that need to be addressed.

Another challenge I faced was integrating with Chainlink. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-time data feeds to smart contracts. Integrating with Chainlink was essential for providing real-time ETH to USD conversion rates.

## Accomplishments that I proud of
I are proud of the following accomplishments:

I built a decentralized crowdfunding application that is secure, scalable, and easy to use.
I integrated with Chainlink to provide real-time ETH to USD conversion rates. 

## What I learned
I learned a lot from building CrowdFundIt. Here are some of the most important things I learned:

Decentralized applications are more complex than traditional applications, but they offer a number of advantages, such as security and scalability.
Integrating with Chainlink is essential for providing real-time data feeds to smart contracts.

## What's next for CrowdFundIt
I are excited to continue developing CrowdFundIt and making it the best crowdfunding platform on the market. Here are some of the features I are working on:
